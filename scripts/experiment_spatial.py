"""Spatial cohesion experiment.

Compares spatial_cohesion_mean between normal and no-boundary conditions
to validate that boundary maintenance keeps agents spatially coherent.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/experiment_spatial.py > experiments/spatial_data.tsv

Output: TSV data to stdout + summary to stderr.
        Raw JSON saved to experiments/spatial_{condition}.json.
